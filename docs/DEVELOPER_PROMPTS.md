This file makes your repo **developer-friendly** and ensures everyone (including future contributors) knows how to leverage Copilot effectively.  

Would you like me to also generate a **`docs/PROGRESS.md`** template that you can use to track milestone completion, deployments, and pending features (like a mini project roadmap)? This would help keep your repo organized as development progresses.
